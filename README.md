# Virtual Mouse
An AI-based Mouse Controller using hand gestures in OpenCV.It is a virtual mouse control using fingertip identification and hand gesture recognition.

## Technologies used:
Jupyter,OpenCV,autopy library

## Autopy 
AutoPy is a simple, cross-platform GUI automation library for Python. It includes functions for controlling the keyboard and mouse, finding colours and bitmaps on-screen, and displaying alerts.

### Simulation of Virtual Mouse

### Working 
In this particular simulation, when the index finger and middle finger are stick together, it acts as a moving mouse pointer while if we put down the middle finger, the pointer will click on that particular instance.
